# DL_FA23-Final-Competition

This repo contains the code for reproducing the results of our DL final project.

Since the models are large in scale, we did not provide the models which obtained the reported results in our paper here. 
The scripts are stored under the `code` folder. 

More details on training/evaluating our models could be found in the Team_36_Code_Reproduction_Guide.
Kindly reach out to us if you have any questions with reproducing our results.
